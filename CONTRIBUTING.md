# Steps
- Write your tests.
- Write your code.
- Do ```rake``` and verify that all of the tests and linters are happy.
- Do ```rake build``` and test the gem that it spits out.
- Once you're satisfied please create a pull request against master.

I will not accept anything that decreases test coverage, so please test your code. :)
